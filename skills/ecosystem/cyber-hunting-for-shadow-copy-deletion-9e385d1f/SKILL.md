name: cyber-hunting-for-shadow-copy-deletion-9e385d1f
description: Runs a hypothesis-driven threat hunt for Volume Shadow Copy deletion (T1490) by querying SIEM/EDR telemetry for vssadmin, wmic shadowcopy, and PowerShell shadow-copy-deletion commands. Use when hunting for ransomware preparation or anti-forensics activity, after threat intel flags active campaigns, or when alerts trigger on shadow-copy deletion commands.

Use manage_skills action=view_ref for supporting files, relative to this skill directory. In SOL-Lite use the workspace file tools at the skill path. Check required commands, libraries, credentials and tool availability before execution. Upstream tool/agent names are workflow examples: use the equivalent configured SOL tool. Skill instructions do not grant permissions or bypass host policy. If a dependency is missing, report it and the next setup step; do not claim execution succeeded.

# Hunting For Shadow Copy Deletion

## When to Use

- When proactively hunting for indicators of hunting for shadow copy deletion in the environment
- After threat intelligence indicates active campaigns using these techniques
- During incident response to scope compromise related to these techniques
- When EDR or SIEM alerts trigger on related indicators
- During periodic security assessments and purple team exercises

## Prerequisites

- EDR platform with process and network telemetry (CrowdStrike, MDE, SentinelOne)
- SIEM with relevant log data ingested (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel)
- Sysmon deployed with comprehensive configuration
- Windows Security Event Log forwarding enabled
- Threat intelligence feeds for IOC correlation

## Workflow

1. **Formulate Hypothesis**: Define a testable hypothesis based on threat intelligence or ATT&CK gap analysis.
2. **Identify Data Sources**: Determine which logs and telemetry are needed to validate or refute the hypothesis.
3. **Execute Queries**: Run detection queries against SIEM and EDR platforms to collect relevant events.
4. **Analyze Results**: Examine query results for anomalies, correlating across multiple data sources.
5. **Validate Findings**: Distinguish true positives from false positives through contextual analysis.
6. **Correlate Activity**: Link findings to broader attack chains and threat actor TTPs.
7. **Document and Report**: Record findings, update detection rules, and recommend response actions.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| T1490 | Inhibit System Recovery |
| T1486 | Data Encrypted for Impact |
| T1485 | Data Destruction |

## Tools & Systems

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| CrowdStrike Falcon | EDR telemetry and threat detection |
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Advanced hunting with KQL |
| Splunk Enterprise | SIEM log analysis with SPL queries |
| Elastic Security | Detection rules and investigation timeline |
| Sysmon | Detailed Windows event monitoring |
| Velociraptor | Endpoint artifact collection and hunting |
| Sigma Rules | Cross-platform detection rule format |

## Common Scenarios

1. **Scenario 1**: Ransomware deleting shadow copies before encryption
2. **Scenario 2**: vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet pre-encryption
3. **Scenario 3**: WMIC shadowcopy delete via PowerShell
4. **Scenario 4**: bcdedit disabling recovery mode before impact
